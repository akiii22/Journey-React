# Custom Hooks – React Learning Journey

This section dives into **Custom React Hooks**, an advanced but powerful concept to simplify and reuse logic in components.

---

## What I Learned

### Follows the same rules as regular hooks

Custom hooks **must start with `use`** and follow the **Rules of Hooks** (e.g., no conditional calls).

### Simplifies components

Custom hooks **extract logic** (e.g., fetching, validation) out of UI components to keep them **clean and focused**.

### Reuse functionality across components

A custom hook can be imported and reused anywhere — promoting **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles.
