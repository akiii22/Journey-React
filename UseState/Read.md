- **Controlled Inputs** – managing input values with state
- **Multiple Inputs** – handling multiple state values (e.g., name, email)
- **Arrays & Lists** – adding, removing, and clearing lists
- **Objects in State** – updating object values immutably
- **Toggle Example** – switching states (e.g., show/hide)
- **Clear & Reset Challenge** – with conditional rendering
