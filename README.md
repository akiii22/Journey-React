# Journey-React

This repository is a personal log of my React learning journey, based on the [React Course by Janis Smilga](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-course/).

Here, I’m collecting lecture files, practice snippets, and short examples — mainly focused on **JSX, components, hooks, and React logic**. It’s less about polished projects and more about **learning through writing code**.

---

## What’s Inside?

- Minimal example files (mostly `.jsx`)
- Practice with concepts like state, props, effects, events
- Occasional notes and explanations per topic
- Clean folder structure to follow the course flow

---

## Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a **topic or section** from the course.
